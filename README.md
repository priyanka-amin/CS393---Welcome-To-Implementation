# Welcome To (CS 393)

An implementation of popular board game Welcome To. Includes features such as a rules manager, automated players, and networked play.

## Organization

Code was written to pass autograder tests. Each deliverable has its own folder in the "Deliverables" directory. Code deliverable specifics can be found here (https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/393-2022-spring/). Each subdirectory in "Deliverables" include a "run" file, which runs that assignment's tests, and submitted test cases. "my_python" contains all the code and additional unit tests. 

## Notable deliverables

Deliverables of particular note are the following:

* Assignment 3: Created data structures to represent player board states and game states. 

* Assignments 5 and 6: Wrote playing and scoring functions to generate and evaluate potential moves from board states. 

* Assignment 8: Built server infrastructure to play games with local or remote players.
